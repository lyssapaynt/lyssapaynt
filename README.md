- 👋 Hi, I’m @lyssapaynt
- 👀 I’m interested in skeletal stem cell genes and gene expression in cetaceans. I'm trying to identify genes that haven't yet been identified in cetacean genomes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in Python in my Bioinformatics course at Cal Poly Humboldt and am learning how to code in RStudio for my statistics course. 
- 🐋 For the project in my Bioinformarics course I'm learning how to use Genome WorkBench for gene identification and multiple sequence alignment.
- Here is the link to Genome WorkBench: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/gbench/tutorial29/
